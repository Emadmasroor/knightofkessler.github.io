                    This is really good! There's an English version, but I like this one more. 
                    I want to know more Chinese worship songs... do you know any?

                    <br>
                    这个很好！有这个英语的崇拜之歌。我更喜欢中文的这个。我想认识中文的崇拜之歌。你认识任何？

                <h3>Hello, world</h3>
                <h4>January 1, 2020</h4>
                <p> I've decided to try an experiment. I'm going to start putting the stuff that I normally put on Facebook
                    here.
                    <br><br>
                    Why?
                    <br><br>
                    Well, I want to reclaim a little piece of the internet; 
                    I want to reduce my dependence on all-encompassing tech platforms.
                    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/">I'm</a>

                    In fact, in an increasingly polarized political climate, both
                    <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=4758">conservative</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/break-up-big-tech">liberal</a>
                    voices agree that the current balance of power on the web needs to be corrected.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    The internet was constructed as a 
                    decentralized, democratic entity. Its founders took steps to avoid giving
                    control over information to any one organization; they instead offered the common person--albeit the common
                    person who possessed certain technical knowledge--the ability to make himself heard. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, over the past decade, 
                    we have effectively surrendered our right to this gift. Large companies like
                    Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon
                    (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_tech_companies">Big Four</a>) 
                    offered us convenience. Their platforms are easy and engaging to use; in fact, they are 
                    <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/11/facebook-was-designed-to-be-addictive-does-that-make-it-evil.html">
                        made intentionally addicting</a>. These companies, particularly Google, have products that do 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products">so many different things</a>
                    that it is almost impossible to avoid using their ecosystems. We have now abandoned almost everything else.
                    <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-mission-to-decentralize-the-internet">
                        In 2013, requests to Google services comprised 25% of
                        North American internet traffic</a>; 
                    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/amazons-share-of-the-us-e-commerce-market-is-now-49-or-5-of-all-retail-spend/">
                        in 2018, Amazon conducted nearly one-half of all American online e-commerce sales.</a>
                    <br><br>
                    These platforms thrive on user data. They collect 
                    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy">prodigious</a>
                    amounts of personal information and then 
                    <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-sells-future-powered-your-personal-data-n870501">mine it</a> to improve
                    their products. A cycle ensues: Google, for example, has products are better than those of the competitition
                    because Google feeds users' personal data into its algorithms. 
                    Users therefore prefer Google products and feed
                    Google even more data.
                    <br><br>
                    These companies should not be trusted with the user data that they collect. Facebook's carelessness with
                    user information led to the 
                    <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/23/17151916/facebook-cambridge-analytica-trump-diagram">
                        Cambridge Analytica</a>
                    scandal, in which a political consulting organization disingenuously gained access to raw data from 87 million
                    accounts. Jigsaw, a think tank owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, 
                    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/20/googles-earth-how-the-tech-giant-is-helping-the-state-spy-on-us">interferes
                        in Middle Eastern geopolitics</a>
                    in ways that sometimes indirectly utilize user information. Google once agreed
                    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/20/googles-earth-how-the-tech-giant-is-helping-the-state-spy-on-us">
                        to give the NSA network traffic metrics</a>
                    in exchange for information regarding foreign hackers.
                    <br><br>
                    These companies' platforms have other issues: they create 
                    <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/facebook-algorithm-echo-chambers_b_7259916">ideological echo chambers</a>
                    and often operate according to
                    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/11/facebook-censorship-news-feed-trending-topics">opaque</a>
                    censorship rules which are

                    I think we need to start from scratch. On this website, I have more control over my own data.
                    Sure, it's hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which is owned by Microsoft--
                    but at least it lacks an opaque algorithm that feeds us what it wants us to consume. 
                    I'd ideally have my own server
                    or use some sort of blockchain-based hosting scheme, but I feel like this little Status section of my 
                    website--which I'll use for microblogging as on Facebook or Twitter--is a step in the right direction.
