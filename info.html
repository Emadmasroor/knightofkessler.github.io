               Hi! My name's Joshua Fitzgerald (aka the Knight of Kessler).

               <br><br>

               I'm a first-year PhD student in the Engineering Mechanics graduate program at Virginia Tech;
               I study tube dynamics in <a href="https://shaneross.com">Dr. Shane Ross's Lab</a>.
               I got my bachelor's degree in mathematics at <a href="https://greensboro.edu">Greensboro College</a> in Greensboro, North Carolina.

               <br><br>

               <!--

               <b>What are your views on [insert topic here]?</b>

               The short answer is that my views are confusing. Do you want me to give you the long answer?

               <b>Uh... Well...</b>

               Great! I'm happy to share it with you. The long answer is that my views on religion, politics, and philosophy
               are informed by three "lenses. One is philosophical, one is religious, and one is political. The 
               lens corresponding to a particular field forms the foundation of my thought in that area; the other two lenses
               may also come into play to give my beliefs more structure.

               <br>
               The three lenses underlying my beliefs are as follows:

               <ol>
                   <li>The concept of the 
                       <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)>Golden Mean</a> (philosophical lens)</li>
                    <li>My Christian faith (religious lens)</li>
                    <li>My optimism regarding democracy (political lens)</li>
               </ol>

               <b>Um... ok.</b>

               Yeah. Those are the lenses. 

               <b>I don't see any glass. WHERE'S THE GLASS (or are these lenses acrylic)?</b>

               It's a metaphorical thing. I just use the word "lens" to refer to a guiding framework, assumption, or
               question that is used to investigate these issues.

               <b>Oh.</b>

               Anyhow: 
               I am not a philosopher by trade, so my philosophical beliefs mainly stem from concepts that I encountered
               during my undergrad Honors classes (so humor me). The main principle that guides my philosophical ideas 
               and therefore affects my religious and political beliefs is the Golden Mean, a principle often associated
               with Aristotelian thought. Maimonides, a medieval Jewish philosopher, summarized the Golden Mean as follows:

               <blockquote>
                    "If a man finds that his nature tends or is disposed to one of these extremes..., 
                    he should turn back and improve, so as to walk in the way of good people, which is the right way. 
                    The right way is the mean in each group of dispositions common to humanity; 
                    namely, that disposition which is equally distant from the two extremes in its class,
                    not being nearer to the one than to the other."
               </blockquote>

               In general, the Golden Mean asserts that virtue is to be found between two extremes. 
               
               I tend to apply this hypothesis to the analysis of ideology. 
               In my opinion, one should recognize that most ideologies typically have
               both good ideas and bad ideas; therefore, one can pull ideas from multiple ideologies.
               
               For example, Karl Marx in, for example, <i>Das Kapital</i> convincingly argues that the workers in his time
               were horribly mistreated and that someone needed to take action to alleviate their plight. He provides concrete,
               unambiguous historical evidence that shows that members of the working class had to work long hours in
               dangerous factories for meager pay. one finds it difficult to disagree that the workers were 
               being exploited. I would argue (but you certainly don't have to agree with me) that Marx was right in that respect.
               
               However, Marx transformed class struggles into a cosmic conflict with eschatological consequences that
               required preposterously radical solutions; he even states that 
               "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles" (quoted from the Communist Manifesto).
               The workers, Marx thought, 
               



               Religiously, I'm a Christian; I believe that Jesus is the Son of God who died to save mankind from sin. 
               My theology is fairly centrist with Baptist, Pentecostal, Messianic Jewish,
               and Social Gospel influences.
               
               Politically, then, I consider myself a right-of-center 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_centrism">Radical Centrist</a>
               and a follower of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_democracy">Christian Democracy</a> 
               (not to be confused with the American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">
               Democratic Party</a>, with which I am not affiliated).
